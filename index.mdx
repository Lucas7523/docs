## Introduction

AgentEarth is dedicated to providing AI Agents with convenient, secure, and fast external services. We expand Agents' capabilities to make your AI Agents more powerful.

Traditionally, when an Agent needs to call MCP tools, developers must:
* Search for proper MCPs one by one
* Register accounts on each MCP host platform
* Deploy and install the MCPs
* Configure MCP to the Agent
* Monitor and resolve quality issues and anomalies in MCP calls
With AgentEarth, everything becomes super simple. You just need to login and create a key (token) for your Agent—then it can access all MCP services seamlessly.

AgentEarth selects high-quality MCPs, optimizes interface quality and speed, and provides full monitoring and maintenance. This eliminates the hassle of managing MCPs on your own.

## How to Use?

- Create API Keys
  - After logging in, click "API Keys" in the upper right corner to create a key.
  - A key represents the right to access a set of resources. We recommend using different keys for different Agents.
- Configure MCPs for Your Agent
  - On each MCP page, copy the MCP connection information (JSON string).
  - Add the JSON string to your Agent's MCP settings to start using the MCP.
